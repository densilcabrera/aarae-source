AARAE is a Matlab-hosted environment for the measurement, processing and analysis of audio system and acoustic system responses.

The aim of AARAE is to encourage exploration of methods and concepts, rather than to present single approaches to problems. In this sense it is particularly aimed at supporting research and education.

One of AARAE's most important features is easy extensibility. With only a small amount of additional code, new generators, processors, analysers or calculators can be created by dragging and dropping a Matlab function into the appropriate folder.

This Google Code site mainly exists to host the AARAE code repository, for the project's developers and for users who wish to stay up-to-date via svn. For simple downloading of the AARAE code (with much less frequent updates), go to:
