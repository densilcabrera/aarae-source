AARAE requires wav files with the following names:

REFERENCE_AUDIO.wav
SILENCE_PLEASE.wav
THANKYOU.wav

These must be in this directory (/Audio/REQUIRED_AUDIO).

You can substitute your own recordings for these if you prefer, but they must have these exact names. These should be 1-channel wav files, with a suggested sampling rate of 44.1 or 48 kHz.
