function OUT = SilenceSweep_Farina2009(n,fadeindur,fadeoutdur,fs,gapdur,deltaL)
% This function generates the 'silence sweep' as described by Angelo
% Farina:
%
% A. Farina (2009) "Silence Sweep: a novel method for measuring
% electro-acoustical devices," 126th AES Convention, Munich, Germany
%
% The test signal consists of a period of silence, then the silence sweep,
% then the exponential sweep. The duration of the gap between these 3
% elements is specified as a user parameter. The default parameters are
% those used in the paper, however a more sensitive analysis can be achived
% by using a longer fade-in and fade-out duration for the sweep (e.g. 1 s,
% perhaps with a higher order MLS). However, note that the fade-in and
% fade-out duration limit the effective frequency range of the sweep. The
% sensitivity of the test signal can be explored by analysing the test
% signal itself (without playing it through an audio system).
%
% Although Farina puts the silence in the middle, in this implementation
% the silence is first because this avoids any possibility that system
% reverberation could intrude into the silence.
%
% Note that in his presentation, Angelo Farina speculated that the rms
% level of the sweep should perhaps be 8-12 dB less than that of the
% silence sweep, although in his examples he states that they were the same
% rms level (creating a strange result where 2nd order harmonic distortion
% from the sweep is greater than THD+N from the silence sweep). This can be
% controlled using the last user parameter (deltaL), which attenuates the
% silence sweep, regardless of its sign.
%
% Use the SilenceSweepAnalysis analyser (in Non-LTI analysis) to analyse
% recordings made with this test signal. Alternatively, you can analyse it
% 'manually' by using the '*' (convolve audio with audio2) button.
