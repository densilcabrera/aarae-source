% This function generates a linear sweep (Optimized Aoshima Time Streteched Pulse)
% and its inverse filter for impulse response measurement,
% based on the concepts in:
% 
% Yôiti Suzuki, Futoshi Asano, Hack-Yoon Kim, Toshio Sone (1995)
% "An optimum computer-generated pulse signal suitable for the measurement 
% of very long impulse responses"
% Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 97(2):1119-1123
%
% Rather than a sweep from 0 Hz to the Nyquist frequency, this function
% uses a lower sampling rate to generate the sweep, which is then upsampled
% (along with its inverse filter). This allows the OATSP to be used for
% measurements focussing on the low frequency range.
%
% INPUTS
%
% * dur: duration in seconds. Short durations may be problematic if the
% upsampling factor is large.
%
% * upsamplingfactor: upsampling factor is a positive number, which
% is the ratio between the sampling rate of the audio and the sampling rate
% at which the OATSP signal was generated. For example, if the audio
% sampling rate is 48000 Hz, and the upsampling factor is 100, then the
% sweep will be generated using an initial sampling rate of 480 Hz (and
% hence will span 0 Hz - 240 Hz).
%
% * resample_n and resample_beta: these are filter design parameters used
% by Matlab's resample function (see Matlab's help for further
% information).
% 
% * mratio is the OATSP design parameter (refer to the paper by Suzuki et
% al).
%
% * fs: sampling rate of the output audio.
%
% * donorm: whether or not to normalize the wave.
%
% * reverse: whether or not to time-reverse the sweep (and its inverse
% filter) - which are in fact the time reverse of each other.
