function H = minphasefreqdomain(mag,thresholddB,timeshift)
% This function caclulates the frequency domain complex coefficients
% equivalent to a minimum phase filter, using a magnitude spectrum as
% input (which is assumed to be real valued).
%
% INPUTS:
% mag - magnitude spectrum from which to derive the complex coefficients
%
% thresholddB - threshold in decibels (relative to the maximum value of the
% magnitude spectrum): values below this are assigned this value to avoid
% problems that arise with very large dynamic ranges or deep notches in the
% spectrum. The default value is -120 dB. Note that this only affects the
% phase response of the filter - the output magnitude of the filter is
% replicated from the function's input mag.
%
% timeshift (0 or 1) - apply a circular time shift so that the impulse
% response starts and ends at a zero-crossing. If this input is missing,
% then a time shift is not applied. This time shift is most useful if the
% filter is going to be used with linear convolution (rather than simply by
% spectrum multiplication equivalent to circular convolution). However, by
% shifting the impulse response, the minimum phase characteristic of the
% filter is compromised. Note that a longer filter may reduce the need for
% this operation (by reducing temporal aliasing, or filter impulse response
% wrap-around). Other approaches to fixing the ends of the impulse response
% could be to apply a small fade-in and fade-out (a window function) after
% calling this function, or to smooth the spectrum magnitude (and reduce
% its contrast) prior to calling this function.
%
%
%
% To run this filter, multiply in frequency domain, and then return to time
% domain using ifft.
