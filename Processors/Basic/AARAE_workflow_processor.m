function OUT = AARAE_workflow_processor(IN,filename)
% This function provides a simple method for running custom-written
% workflow functions, using code adapted from AARAE's log file (or code in 
% a similar style).
%
% Workflow code should be put in AARAE's Workflows directory. Some examples
% of workflow functions are already in that directory.
%
% One purpose of using a workflow might be to avoid (or reduce instances
% of) dialog boxes, which can sometimes be an inefficient way of entering
% function parameters. Hence the parameters can be written in (and read
% from) the workflow file code instead. This can greatly speed up
% processing if you are doing the same thing repeatedly.
%
% Another purpose of using a workflow might be to concatenate a sequence of
% processors to achieve a particular goal. Again, this can reduce the
% amount of tedious interaction with AARAE's user interface if this
% workflow needs to be run many times.
%
% Note that not all dialog boxes can be avoided by using a workflow. Only
% dialog boxes that correspond to function call inputs can be avoided.
